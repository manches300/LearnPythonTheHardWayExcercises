# LearnPythonTheHardWayExcercises
7/1/2017 <br />
This little set of Excercies are my attempt to get through the first python book by Zed Shaw. I have found that his insistence that the student type everything, instead of using copy and paste, actually made me LEARN. It hardcoded the python concept through repetition sometimes to ad naseum. LOL. I embelished many parts of the code to personalize it to me, but stayed with the concept of repetition and just hammering away at it. <br />

I am currently up to excercise 36, which I sorta took as free reign to do whatever I wanted.  I probably bit off a lot more than Zed intended. I also used a few concepts which Zed had not yet introduced. But it was(is) quite a good learning experience.  I am sure that I should probably break this down into modules. But at this point it is all in one huge .py file. <br />

This is by no means a completed repository... it is a work in progress. <br />
